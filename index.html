Hi! I am a first-year master's student in the European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies <a href="https://lct-master.org/contents_2014/overview.php" target="_blank">(LCT)</a>, where I studied <a href="https://offertaformativa.unitn.it/en/lm/cognitive-science" target="_blank"> Cognitive Science</a> at the University of Trento (Italy) and will continue my studies in <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/studium/angebot/master/lst.html" target="_blank">Language Science and Technology</a> at Saarland University (Germany). In 2020, I obtained my Bachelor degree in  <a href="https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/artificial-intelligence/?lang=en" target="_blank"> Artificial Intelligencee</a> from the University of Groningen (The Netherlands).<br>

<p>
My research interest lies at the intersection between computation, cognition, and language. Specifically, I am curious about how two discourse segments are logically connected to each other, how people handle these connections in multimodal and multilingual contexts, and how we can build better AI systems on top of that. My current work (or attempts) focus(es) on language & vision and  computational discourse. I am supported by Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Full Scholarship.<br> 

<p> When not in front of a screen, I enjoy all kinds of non-digital activities, such as reading, swimming, and cycling.<br>
