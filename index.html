Hi! I am a final year master's student in the European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies <a href="https://lct-master.org/contents_2014/overview.php" target="_blank">(LCT)</a>, where I study <a href="https://offertaformativa.unitn.it/en/lm/cognitive-science" target="_blank"> Cognitive Science</a> at the University of Trento (Italy) and <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/studium/angebot/master/lst.html" target="_blank">Language Science and Technology</a> at Saarland University (Germany). In 2020, I obtained my Bachelor degree in  <a href="https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/artificial-intelligence/?lang=en" target="_blank"> Artificial Intelligence</a> from the University of Groningen (The Netherlands).<br>

<p>
My research interest lies at the intersection between computation, cognition, and language. In general, I am curious about how two discourse segments are logically connected to each other, and how people handle these connections in multimodal (eg. language and vision) or multilingual contexts, with the due goal of developing human-like computational models. I am generously supported by Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Full Scholarship.<br>
